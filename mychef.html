        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>For my very first UX project, I was tasked with creating a mobile app on any topic of my choosing, but it had to include an “expert” feature which would allow users to schedule video chats with professionals. As a huge foodie, I decided to
          create a food app where users could speak to culinary experts about cooking problems, meal planning, recipes, and more.</p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>To create a personalized food app containing recipes, a pantry inventory feature, cooking tips, and the ability to talk to a real culinary professional.</p>
        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>As I would quickly learn, I had to take on several different roles for this project. Not only was I the UX designer, but I was also the UI designer, the user researcher, the interviewer, and the user tester. A UX designer wears many hats!

        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>October 2020 to May 2021</p>

          <h3>Empathize</h3>
          <p>I initially determined the problem with people’s frustrations with current food apps on the market, performed competitive analysis of those apps, and came up with a solution that would solve those frustrations. I conducted user surveys
            and interviews to further explore pain points and find out what people really wanted.</p>

          </picture>
          <h3>Define</h3>
          <p>Once I had enough user data, I created user personas based on a combination of interviewees. These personas would allow me to stay on track as I moved forward with the goals of the design. Next, I defined a few potential features of the
            app and took each persona on a journey using them, which allowed me to create actual task flows for how each feature should work.</p>

          </picture>
          <h3>Ideate</h3>
          <p>I began creating the information architecture for the app to lay out exactly what should be included and where. Using that and the task flows, I created low-fidelity wireframes using pen and paper sketches, and then transformed those to
            digital mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>

          <h3>Prototype</h3>
          <p>From my mid-fidelity wireframes, I was able to create high-fidelity wireframes and turn them into a working prototype.</p>

          <h3>Test</h3>
          <p>Using the prototype, I recruited several participants to test out the features and complete specific tasks. My goal was to see how intuitive and user-friendly my designs actually were.</p>

          <h3>Iterate</h3>
          <p>Using data from my user testing, I was able to correct several errors in the prototype. I also shared my prototype with fellow UX peers, who provided additional suggestions for improvement, which were all implemented. Finally, I
            validated my designs against the web accessibility guidelines and found even more things to improve upon. I created a style guide for the app at the very end of the project.</p>

          <!-- CONCLUSION BLOCK -->
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>The journey of creating MyChef was an extraordinary, challenging learning experience: from research and analysis, to empathizing with users, to actual design and new software skills. The most important thing I learned early in the
            process was that I wasn’t designing for myself; I was designing for the user. It was amazing to see how my designs evolved from the beginning to where they are now, and I’m excited to continuously improve them in the future.</p>
